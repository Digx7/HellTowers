**Synopsis:**

[comment]:<> (Start of Entry Body)

  The Player wakes up on a blank map next to their powered down S.O.S. beacon.  This beacon is all that will get the player off the planet.  However, the local aliens seem to be drawn by it’s power.  Keep them away by constructing defenses using scrap metal lying around the map. The player can explore this map and set up their defenses. But once they turn on the S.O.S. beacon the aliens will start swarm in.  Coming in waves the player must use all their resources to keep the aliens from destroying them or the beacon.

<h3><u>Design Document</h3></u>

>This document describes how GameObjects behave, how they’re controlled and their properties. This is often referred to as
the “mechanics” of the game. This documentation is primarily concerned with
the game itself. This part of the document is meant to be modular, meaning you could have
several different Game Design Documents attached to the Concept Document.

<b>Design Guidelines</b>

>This is an important statement about any creative restrictions that need to be considered and includes brief statements
about the general (i.e., overall) goal of the design.

<b>Game Design Definitions</b>

>This section established the definition of the game play. Definitions should include how a player wins, loses, transitions
between levels, and the main focus of the gameplay.

<b>Game Flowchart</b>

>The game flowchart provides a visual of how the different game elements and their properties interact. Game flowcharts
should represent Objects, Properties, and Actions present in the game. Each of these items should have a number reference
to where they exist within the game mechanics document.

<b>Player Definition</b>

>- Use this section for quick descriptions that define the player
>- Use the Player Properties section (below) to define the properties for each player. Player Properties can be
affected by the player’s action or interaction with other game elements. Define the properties and how they affect
the player’s current game.
>- Use the Player Rewards section to make a list of all objects that affect the player in a positive way. Define these
objects by describing what affect they cause and how the player can use the object.

<b>User Interface (UI)</b>

>This is where you’ll include a description of the user’s control of the game. Think about which buttons on a device would be
best suited for the game. Consider what the worst layout is, then ask yourself if your UI is it still playable. A visual
representation can be added where you relate the physical controls to the actions in the game. When designing the UI, it may
be valuable to research quality control and user interface (UI) design information.
